## The Stonewall Uprising

The modern LGBTQ+ rights movement began with the Stonewall Uprising in June 1969, when patrons of the Stonewall Inn in New York City resisted a police raid. This sparked days of protests and became a catalyst for the movement.

## First Pride Marches

The first Pride marches occurred in 1970 on the anniversary of Stonewall in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. These events were both celebratory and political, demanding equal rights.

## Key Milestones:

- 1973: American Psychiatric Association removes homosexuality from its list of mental disorders
- 2003: Lawrence v. Texas decriminalizes same-sex relationships
- 2015: Obergefell v. Hodges legalizes same-sex marriage nationwide
- 2020: Bostock v. Clayton County protects LGBTQ+ employees from discrimination

## Pride Today

What began as protest has evolved into global celebrations every June, while continuing to advocate for equality. Major corporations now participate, though some criticize this as "rainbow capitalism."
